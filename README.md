# Akbank-ML-Bootcamp-2024
In this project, a basic data set has been selected. In line with the instructions, a Kaggle dataset was used, which basically gives the quality of red wines as the output value. The general values and variables of this dataset were first examined.
Afterwards, the trend of these variables was summarized using graphs.
Data was prepared in advance in line with the instructions. Random Forest model was used in model selection, taking the outputs into consideration. Optimization was achieved in the best way using randomized search. Finally, the real and predicted classes were compared using the confusion matrix, and values such as the F1 score, which was the closest estimate of the accuracy of the model, were explained.
